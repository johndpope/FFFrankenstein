# FFrankenstein

FFrankenstein is a Swift wrapper around the `ffmpeg` command line tool.

Once it's complete, you will be able to access most of the data from an `ffprobe` JSON output, in a safely typed way, as Swift data structures. You will also be able to transcode videos, capture still images from frames, and more.

FFrankenstein is still a work in progress and not yet ready for production use. It cannot be used via Swift Package Manager since it has no releases yet. But keep your eyes peeled for more...
